			<story>
        It is believed to have taken 20 years and as many as 100,000 workers to complete the Great Pyramid.<para/>
				There is much speculation about the construction methodologies and intentions of the pyramid, including references to the moon, the Orion constellation, continental gravity, and more.<para/>
				What is known, however, is that the four sides of the base are more than 700 feet long, and differ in length by no more than 8 inches.

        Located on the island of Pharos in the harbor of Alexandria, the lighthouse may be the most famous lighthouse in history. The lighthouse was very different than modern lighthouses in that it was built in three stages, all sloping inward.<para/>
				The Lighthouse of Alexandria was so famous in ancient times that the island on which it stood, Pharos, became the root word for lighthouse in many languages (for example, "phare" in French).

				The monument was built as a tomb for Mausolus, a governor in the Persian Empire. Sparing no expense, his widowed wife Artemisia (who was also his sister as was considered customary) commissioned well-known Greek architects and artists to design the tomb.<para/>
				The monument stood for nearly 17 centuries and was eventually destroyed by a series of earthquakes. And, like the Lighthouse of Alexandria, the tomb was so famous that Mausolus's name has become the root word for large tombs in many languages (for example, "mausoleo" in Spanish).</story>
